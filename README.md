# Oh My Fish!

### Why?
  Developing on a shell should be a pleasure. Our goal is to help developers that do not want to spend time configuring their own computer to spend time doing what they want.

### How?
  With the power of our community, we take the already awesome [fish shell][fish] to another level by creating simple-to-use plugins and themes.

[fish]: http://fishshell.com/

### What?
  Oh-my-fish is a user-friendly framework for managing your fish-shell configuration. It includes optional plugins (brew, git-flow, rails, python, node, etc) and themes.

<br>
## Installation

Oh-my-fish is built for recent versions of the fish shell, namely "fish 2.0".

```fish
curl -L https://github.com/bpinto/oh-my-fish/raw/master/tools/install.fish | fish
```

**NOTE**: The installation script renames your existing `config.fish` to `config.orig`, and replaces it with [the default oh-my-fish config](https://github.com/bpinto/oh-my-fish/blob/master/templates/config.fish). If you have existing customizations to your fish config, you will need to manually include those customizations after the install.

If you want to install it manually, [keep reading](#manual-installation).

## Usage

Open your fish configuration file `~/.config/fish/config.fish` and specify the theme and the plugins you want to use. And then run `fish install` on your terminal to install them.

Before setting down on a theme, you might want to have a go with all themes using our quick [theme switcher](https://github.com/bpinto/oh-my-fish/blob/master/plugins/theme/README.md) by typing `theme --help` on your shell.

## Customization

If you have many functions which go well together, you can create custom plugin in the `custom/plugins/PLUGIN_NAME`
directory and add to it as many functions as you want.

If you would like to use your custom theme, move it with the same name in the `custom/themes/` directory
and it will override the original theme in `themes/`.

If you just want to override any of the default behavior or add some environment variables,
just add a new file (ending in .load) into the `custom/` directory.

## Contributing

Create an [issue](https://github.com/bpinto/oh-my-fish/issues) linking to your repository and we will move it to the [oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish) organization.

### Manual installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```fish
   git clone git://github.com/bpinto/oh-my-fish.git ~/.oh-my-fish
   ```

2. Create a new fish config by copying the fish template we've provided.
   ```fish
   cp ~/.oh-my-fish/templates/config.fish ~/.config/fish/config.fish
   ```

3. Start / restart fish (just open a new terminal)

## Uninstall

    rm -rf ~/.oh-my-fish
